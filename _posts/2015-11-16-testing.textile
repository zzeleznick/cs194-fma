<notextile>
Here we will examine how to create photo mosaics from a series of images shot along a rotational axis.
All images were shot by hand with the iPhone 6 default camera appliction.

<h2>  II. Image Homographies </h2>
<notextile>
In order to stitch images shot from different perspectives together, we need to first
determine a perspective transformation matrix (3 x 3) that will rectify our target image to
match the same perspective of our base image. This paper illustrates the math behind our
operations </notextile>[1].

<h2> III. Aperature Adjustment </h2>
<notextile>
The resulting rectified image wi
By averaging over a large image array (sampled over the grid perpendicular to the optical axis), we can mimic
a camera with a much larger aperture. In essence we are allowing more light to enter the camera,
which blurs the pixels closest to the lens. With fewer images, the result models an
image taken with a smaller aperture.

<h2 class="center"> IV. Summary </h2>

<notextile>
Overall, I found this to be an interesting project that reinforced my understanding of the properties of cameras and lightfields.
I was initially surprised to learn that increasing the relative aperature size was reducing the quality dramatically,
but I then recalled my the knowledge I gleaned from constructing our pinhole camera: a smaller aperature
can create a sharper image. If I revisit this project, I would like to play around with generating a photosphere.
