You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more,
who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face.
And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again.

I spent more time per week on this course
than I hours put it for one semester of my humanities courses -- both of which
I received highest marks.
