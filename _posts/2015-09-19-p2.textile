    In this project we designed a pinhole camera ("camera obscura"),
    which is essentially a dark box with a pinhole on one face,
    and a screen on the opposite side.
    Light reflecting off a focal object is directed through the pinhole onto the screen,
    and an inverted image of the object is formed.
    The caveat is that it is hard to see projected image with the naked eye alone.
    In order to see the image clearly, we will use a digital camera with a long exposure time (15-30 seconds)
    attached to the pinhole camera.

<h2>  II. Implementation </h2>
<notextile>
For our pinhole camera, we used a shoebox for our camera body,
hole-punched index cards for our aperatures,
and a DSLR camera capturing our projected images.
We noticed that with a larger opening, more photons were able to pass through our pinhole and project onto the opposite face.
Yet, the clarity of the image was greatly reduced due to the scattering effect of light.
Exposure time was a second parameter we could adjust, and with the smaller pinhole keeping the exposure time constant
resulted in much darker, but sharper images.

<h2> III. Results </h2>
<notextile>
We used 100mm, 3cm, and 5cm diameters for our apeture sizes, and 30s, 30s, 15s shutter speeds respectively.
The best shot we took used the medium size pinhole of 3cm diameter at an exposure time of 30 seconds.
However, we were limited to a max of 30 second shutter speed by our camera,
so we weren't able to increase exposure time to adjust for low-light settings.

<h2> IV. Light Painting </h2>
<notextile>
After working so hard on our pinhole camera, we thought we would use our DSLR
and LED-powered light wands to create some novel masterpieces.

Next, we used a high-powered green laser to create some interesting lightning-like effects.

Lastly, we used an Android application to display text as light sequentially from our phone's screen.

<h2 class="center"> VIII. Summary </h2>

<notextile>
Overall, this project was quite fun, and one of the few times I had to troubleshoot mechanical issues
for a computer science project.
